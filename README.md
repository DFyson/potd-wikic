# potd-wikic
Wikimedia Picture of the Day Background

Script which downloads current and future POTD from Wikimedia Commons, adds a summary caption to the bottom, and sets as desktop background image for gnome. Can also be setup on a server to download images any desired time of the day then mirror them for faster retrival from personal devices on the LAN.

Has been tested on Ubuntu. Could be used on a RaspberryPi powered digital picture frame. Need to impliment auto cleanup for old images.
