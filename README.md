# potd-wikic
Wikimedia Commons Picture of the Day Background

Script which downloads current and future POTD from Wikimedia Commons, adds a summary caption to the bottom, and sets as desktop background image for GNOME. Can also be setup on a server to allow bandwith management (download images any time of the day then mirror them for faster retrival from personal devices on the LAN).

Has been tested on Ubuntu. Could be used for such things as a Raspberry Pi powered digital picture frame, etc.
